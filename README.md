### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
-------------

 Here are a few things about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on COINx, MXG, DESgeo and a few other projects...  I share a philosophy that I read about in an aritcle, 
      but can't find the article so am unable to quote it.  The Philosopy is "Build for Interoperability".  I will overlay
      another Philosophy on top of that and it goes by the acronym CANI, which means "Constant and Neverending Improvement.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about a variety of Blockchains and how to create new things by working with 3 or 4 at a time.  
      Sometimes that gets a little chaotic, so I put together this place to help manage projects & keep things somewhat organized.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m always open for collaboration.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with stuff all the time.  I typically work alone, 
      but prefer to accomplish things as part of a 2-4 person team.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything & if I have an answer I'll share it.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy taking a cruise in my car to brainstorm & I do a lot of brainstorming.

Core Philosophy MishMash:
A number of months ago, I will update that date when I get a chance to dig it out, I became aware of some DeFi info.  Basic stuff really about the DeFi building style being much like snapping lego blocks together.  Basically, the snapping of existing DeFi lego blocks together to create new things (products & services).  The Core Philosophy of those building DeFi in the lego block style is "Build for Interoperability".  I like that Philosphy and also build in that way, it reminds me of Object Oriented Programming.

Thank you for dropping by.
I will add more when I get around...
