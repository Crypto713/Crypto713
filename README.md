### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
-------------

 Here are a few things about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a variety of projects.  Here is a philosophy that I read about in an aritcle, 
      but can't find the article so am unable to quote it.  The Philosopy is "Build for Interoperability".  I will overlay
      another Philosophy on top of that and it goes by the acronym CANI, which means "Constant and Neverending Improvement.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about a variety of Blockchains and how to create new things by working with 3+ at a time.  
      Sometimes that gets a little chaotic, so I put together this place to help manage projects & keep things somewhat organized.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m always open for collaboration.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking to collaborate all the time.  I typically work alone, 
      but prefer to accomplish things as part of a 2-4 person team.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything & if I have an answer I'll share it.  If I don't have an answer I might be able to find one.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy taking a cruise in my car to brainstorm & I do a lot of brainstorming.

Core Philosophy (MishMash):

Awhile ago I became aware of some DeFi info.  Basic stuff really about a DeFi building style much like snapping lego blocks together.  Basically, the snapping of existing DeFi blocks (tools) together to create new things (products & services).  The Core Philosophy of those building DeFi in this style is "Build for Interoperability".  I like that Philosphy and also build in that way, it reminds me of Object Oriented Programming.


Thank you for dropping by.
I will add more when I get around...
