### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
-------------

 Here are a few things about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on DESgeo and a few other projects...  I share a philosophy that I read about in an aritcle, 
      but can't find the article so am unable to quote it.  The Philosopy is "Build for Interoperability".

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about a variety of Blockchains and how to create new things by working with 3 or 4 at a time.  
      Sometimes that gets a little chaotic, so I put together this place to help manage projects & keep things somewhat organized.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m always open for collaboration.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with stuff all the time.  I typically work alone, 
      but prefer to accomplish things as part of a 2-4 person team.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything & if I have an answer I'll share it.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me:  https://mrstx.org 

- âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy taking a cruise in my car to brainstorm & I do a lot of brainstorming.

Thank you for dropping by.
